# Ops — hub.py/hub_peer.py Architecture Conformance Audit (2026-07-24)

> Method: 12 rounds of mutual adversarial code audit (ag.deepthink + cx.deepthink),
> cross-reviewed until unanimous agreement, several claims independently
> spot-verified by the terminal (cc) directly against live source. Several
> bugs were reproduced with real probes (not just static analysis) —
> tagged `[live-repro]` below.
>
> **Why this exists / relation to packaging:** `ops/phase2-arch-general-specific-2026-07-22.md`
> §14.2 explicitly names `orchestration.json`'s `hub_nodes` adapter pattern as
> the architectural precedent for the eventual packaged Engram Core's
> `PeerAdapter` contract (§13.12 `adapter-conformance/v1`). This audit
> hardens that reference implementation — it is on the packaging critical
> path, not a tangent. The target architecture used as the conformance
> baseline (converged separately, same session, 3 rounds each):
>
> 1. **Hub Orchestration** (peer-neutral): routing, admission, task envelope,
>    session scope, fingerprint gate, persistence, audit, health, retry policy.
> 2. **Transport Infrastructure**: general process supervisor (deadlines,
>    leases, process-tree kill, telemetry) + platform I/O backends (`Pipe`,
>    `InheritTerminal`, `Pty` with a persistent `PtySession` handle) — no
>    vendor method names, prompt grammars, or silence heuristics here.
> 3. **Peer Adapter**: invocation plan, transport selection, protocol codec,
>    session control, peer-error classification, capability probing,
>    peer-specific idle/progress policy.
>
> **Meta-note (2026-07-24):** the first attempt to save this exact file was
> itself reverted, live, by the governed-mutation guard bug documented in
> §4/§5 below (Top-5 #2) — the terminal wrote this file while an unrelated
> `ag.deepthink` ask was in flight, and the guard's no-causal-attribution
> flaw treated the terminal's own legitimate concurrent write as an
> unauthorized mutation during that ask and reverted it. Real-time,
> unplanned confirmation of the bug it describes.
>

## Top 5 priority (P0/P1, updated after Round 9 findings)

| Rank | Bug | Where | Fix status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mutation broker has no real transactional guarantees | `hub.py` broker (§2) | **Designed, NOT YET APPLIED** — "High risk" per its own design (deliberately surfaces previously-hidden sandbox failures); full CAS/lock-unification design in §6, un-implemented |
| 2 | Governed-mutation guard has no causal attribution across concurrent asks; can blame an innocent ask, let the real culprit escape, or destroy authorized output. **No global dispatch lock exists — confirmed practically triggerable, not theoretical (self-demonstrated 3 separate times against docs written during this same session).** | `hub.py:5023-5081`, `4325-4351` | **No fix design exists at all** — highest-severity unfixed item, blocked on a design round that never happened |
| 3 | Final Arbiter override has zero effect on canonical consensus state (DIR-005 non-functional as implemented; `routing-config.json:221`'s "SHIPPED and ACTIVATED" claim is false) | `hub.py:6498-6536`, `4829-4863` | ✅ **APPLIED & committed** (`feb7d22`) — includes a 2nd-round fix for a duplicate-invocation race cx found during implementation verification (direct-vote vs broker-merge paths could double-invoke the arbiter); real multi-process race tests confirmed exactly-once semantics |
| 4 | Lockless read-modify-write race in `action_append_handoff` | `hub.py:9765-9790` | ✅ **APPLIED & committed** (`28b4d67`) — verified with a live 2-process concurrency test |
| 5 | `_classify_ask_failure` needle-matching order misclassifies transient failures as permanent (e.g. "rate limit: token quota exceeded" → `auth_error`) | `hub.py:1714-1774` | ✅ **APPLIED & committed** (`28b4d67`) — verified against 10 real test strings |
| — | **Strong Top-5 contender, CONFIRMED live in the real production dispatch path (Round 11 §8 + Round 12 §9):** every single `ag.*` profile is checked against a fabricated 200k context window instead of its real 1M+ window, because ContextGate's model lookup falls back to the non-model root id `"ag"`. A real, non-spawning probe through the actual `action_ask()` call chain with a genuine `ag.standard` dispatch confirmed `model_id_received_by_ContextGate="ag"`, `context_limit_used=200000` against a real configured `runtime_context_window` of 1,048,576. Blast radius is the entire `ag` peer, likely silently mis-pruning/failing-over ag work all session. | `hub.py:5466,5468`, `hub_context.py:117` | **Not yet designed** |
| — | **`_peer_effective_health()`/`_healthy_peer()` ignore profile-level `gate_open`** (§4) | `hub.py:2360-2413` | ✅ **APPLIED & committed** (`28b4d67`) — centralized via the existing SSOT `snapshot.profile_health_gate_open()`, verified with 5+ cases including the exact expired-cooldown race |

**2026-07-24, post-audit implementation session**: 4 of 6 hub.py fixes above are now applied, each independently tested (direct real probes, not just review) and cross-verified by the OTHER peer before commit — 2 of the 4 (arbiter override, and this diag.py work's own Fix 1/2 below) needed a genuine second correction round after cross-review caught a real remaining bug, confirming the one-fix-at-a-time-with-real-verification discipline was load-bearing, not ceremonial. Separately, `_sys/cli/diag.py`'s EXH sort-order/coupon-urgency issues (found in this same follow-up conversation, not originally part of the 47-bug audit above) were also fixed and committed: `cde0b40` (row sort order now matches the displayed EXH metric) and `10b5567` (urgency-weighted, expiry-aware coupon-EXH discount, replacing a flat divisor). A designed-but-unapplied "terminal-priority EXH" fix (protect whichever peer is acting as `human_interface_peer` from being routed/burned down first) remains queued — see the session memory for the exact remaining design gaps (field-name/data-source verification still needed for `active_delegations`).

---

## 1. Hub Core (Round 1-2, Track A)

1. **Session lifecycle** — mostly conforms (reuse is capability-driven via `session_mode`, scope/fingerprint/extraction are adapter-delegated). Violations: `_classify_resume_failure`/`_classify_ask_failure` do peer-error interpretation in core, not the adapter (see #5 above); `new-topic`/`clear-room` only retire sessions for `_routable_root_peer_ids()`, excluding disabled roots — ag confirmed this has zero runtime impact (disabled nodes are blocked by `is_routable()` at dispatch, so an un-retired session for a disabled node can never load) — downgraded to disk-hygiene debt, not a functional bug.
2. **Quota/routing** — the routing decision layer (`select_load_balanced_peer`, pacing, EXH math) is genuinely peer-neutral. The telemetry PRODUCER (`snapshot.py`) is not: hardcodes real peer binaries/paths (156-175), implements Codex app-server RPC directly (210-260), parses Claude `/usage` directly (413-482), and `gather_peer()` branches explicitly on `ag`/`cc`/`cx` identity (819-1080). **Reset-credit capability gap resolved 2026-07-26:** hub, snapshot, and diag now share one explicit root-peer capability lookup; telemetry presence is not used to infer support.
3. **Consensus/Final Arbiter** — see Top-5 #3. Also: `_decide_consensus()` re-reads voter health LIVE at check-time rather than a round-start snapshot — a voter who validly agreed while healthy can retroactively force `escalated`/`human_gate` if it goes RED afterward, breaking "a previously cast agree remains valid."
4. **Governed mutation guard (base mechanism)** — correctly hub-orchestration-owned in principle (policy manifest-driven, independent hashing, single `try/finally` transaction boundary). Its CONCURRENCY correctness is a separate, serious problem — see Top-5 #2 and §4 below.
5. **IPC/room/quarantine** — mostly peer-neutral. `context-fill --frame` (`hub.py:7611-7658`) embeds prompt-neutralization logic specifically motivated by agy's persistent-session behavior while defaulting differently per peer — cx later found its actual behavioral effect is unverified (it only prints text; `agy_entry.py` doesn't pass that text through argv/stdin to agy — `[TEST NEEDED]`, not confirmed to matter). **Admission gap resolved 2026-07-26:** init-session and send now validate and root-normalize every identity before mutation; non-peer services must be explicitly registered.

## 2. Peer Adapter layer (Round 1-2, Track B)

1. **Invocation construction** — **prompt-staging gap resolved 2026-07-26:** immutable prepared-invocation metadata and the `prepare_input()` adapter hook now own argv/stdin/staged artifacts; only `AgyAdapter` selects pointer-file transport, while core retains cleanup after child-tree supervision. Peer environment construction from `peers.json` remains in core; cx notes this isn't inherently wrong, and only vendor-specific derivation/runtime-home prep would need further adapter ownership.
2. **Session ID/resume** — CONFORMS cleanly, all three adapters (cited file:line ranges verified independently by both auditors).
3. **Error classification** — 100% lives in `hub.py` globally; zero adapter ownership (`PeerAdapter` protocol has no failure-classification hook).
4. **Capability probing** — 100% lives in `check_cli_reality.py`, disconnected from the adapter layer entirely. cx's later refinement: the target architecture doesn't strictly require a `probe_capabilities()` method on every adapter — a probe-definition-in-bundle-manifest model also satisfies it; the current disconnect is real either way.
5. **Profile/flag translation** — `profile_args` is passed through verbatim by every adapter; cx's correction: this is legitimate data-driven translation, not evidence of a bug — "AMBIGUOUS/THIN" was overstated as a violation.

## 3. Ask Transaction, process supervision, RuntimeContext/broker (Round 3, Track C — cx, `[live-repro]` throughout)

1. **ContextGate rejection is swallowed** `[live-repro]` — `ContextGate.check()` raises `ContextGateError` (`hub_context.py:156-163`), but `action_ask`'s exception handling catches it generically and proceeds (`hub.py:5464-5533`); the documented reject branch is unreachable. Probed: injected error, child still executed.
2. **Prune path is always a no-op** `[live-repro]` — the ask passes the ENTIRE query as one removable block (`hub.py:5472-5482`); pruning a single all-encompassing block returns empty, so nothing is ever actually pruned despite the code logging "prune applied." Probed: `pruned_blocks=0`, `query_unchanged=true`.
3. **Pipe transient failures report `sys.exit(0)`** `[live-repro]`, indistinguishable from real success — `hub.py:6145,6161,6177`. The PTY path uses a distinct `SOFT_SKIP_EXIT=7` (`hub.py:5815`) for the identical case, but that exit code is confirmed **completely unconsumed** by any caller anywhere (`action_ask_all`, `_real_arbiter_invoker`, `ctx_save.py`, `ctx_end.py` all ignore return codes). Fully designed fix in §6.
4. **PTY runtime escalation leaves a stale lease "open"** `[live-repro]` — the completed lower-tier lease never gets marked closed before returning during tier escalation (`hub.py:5890-5917`), so it's later treated as expired and its PID killed by the lease-expiry sweep. Probed directly.
5. **Pipe supervision misses small flushed chunks before a long gap on Windows** `[live-repro]` — blocking `stream.read(65536)` plus buffer-growth-only zombie tracking (`hub.py:4057-4111`) killed a real child that had genuinely flushed output moments before going quiet. Existing `test_stream_drain.py` only exercises processes that finish before the zombie window — structurally cannot catch this class.
6. **Broker fallback acknowledges an uncommitted mutation as complete** `[live-repro]` — `_try_broker_fallback()` (`hub.py:692-741`) queues and returns `True`; `_write_json_atomic()` treats that as success (766) though the target is untouched. Probed: queue returned `True`, `leases.json` stayed `{}`, subsequent `_lease_close()` raised `LeaseOwnershipError`.
7. **Broker full-file commits can overwrite newer state** `[live-repro]` — no `expected_revision`/CAS (`hub.py:928-935`); broker-drain and direct writers use DIFFERENT lock names (`broker_{filename}` vs the plain resource name, `hub.py:801` vs `9380`). Probed: state at revision 2 got committed back down to a stale queued revision 1. Root cause synthesis (ag): bugs #6 and #7 are ONE underlying failure — "the broker is an asynchronous, un-isolated file queue pretending to be synchronous transactional storage."

## 4. Health/routing gates, Leadership/locks/handoff, Governance (Round 3, Track D — ag; upgraded by cx in Round 4)

1. **`_peer_effective_health()` ignores profile-level `gate_open`** — root status can read `GREEN` while every profile is closed. Initially rated AMBIGUOUS by ag (since `_healthy_peer()` has a workaround); **upgraded to VIOLATES by cx with a probe**: leader matching, proposal-voter selection, leadership challenges, and governance prechecks call `_peer_effective_health()` DIRECTLY without that workaround, so this can produce real wrong eligibility decisions in consensus/leadership contexts. Fully designed fix in §6.
2. **Lockless read-modify-write race in `action_append_handoff`** — see Top-5 #4. Independently verified directly by the terminal (confirmed `_get_lock` is used pervasively elsewhere — broker/state/mailbox/log — but genuinely absent here).
3. **Governance systems mostly conform** (good news) — proposals/directives/lessons/alerts ARE actually consumed, not write-only: `proposal-vote` auto-writes `INV-xx` invariants on unanimous consensus; `directive-add` entries get injected into every relay frame; lessons get compiled and injected; alerts set global blocked state and broadcast. Only `action_thread_react` is write-only telemetry with no reader. cx's caveat: this "only 1 write-only stub" framing undersells the pattern system-wide — the arbiter's `final_opinions.jsonl` (§1.3) is another instance of the exact same class.

## 5. `check_cli_reality.py`, governed-mutation guard concurrency, test-suite self-audit (Round 8, Track F — cx, `[live-repro]` throughout)

1. **Partial canary successes treated as a complete catalog** `[live-repro]` — `build_observed_capture()` only records `PASS` models; the loader discards source/provenance; any other declared-but-unprobed model becomes false `CONTRADICTED`. **Confirmed live in production data on 2026-07-24**: a real, non-synthetic run against current `orchestration.json` produced 5 false P0 CONTRADICTED verdicts for `ag` models that are all genuinely present in the real live catalog (verified via a real `agy.exe models` call in the same session).
2. **Stale/binary-incompatible captures trusted as fresh** — no `captured_at`/fingerprint/provenance validation before use. Probed with a synthetic cache.
3. **Missing bare-command binaries crash** instead of the documented `ABSENT` verdict (`FileNotFoundError` uncaught). Probed directly.
4. **Failed version probes become observations** — `probe_version()` never checks `returncode`; exit 1 with `"fatal: protocol 9.8.7 unsupported"` returned observed version `9.8.7`. Probed directly.
5. **Governed-mutation guard: no causal attribution across overlapping asks** — see Top-5 #2. Reproduced with two live interleaved helper windows: innocent ask B gets blamed and reverts the change; culprit A's own post-check then sees the (now-reverted) original hash and escapes unflagged. **Independently confirmed practically triggerable by ag**: no global dispatch lock exists anywhere in `action_ask()`/`_action_ask_inner()`. **Self-demonstrated a third time while this document was being written — see meta-note at the top.**
6. **Authorized concurrent output can be wrongly reverted** — an authorized ask skips its own guard snapshot, but an overlapping ORDINARY ask still sees the authorized ask's legitimate output as a violation and reverts it. Probed: `authorized_output_survived=false`.
7. **TOCTOU window even in the "race guard"** — rehash then separate `git checkout` (`hub.py:4325-4351`); a write in between survives undetected.
8. **Guard failures fail OPEN** — pre-ask snapshot or post-check exceptions let `action_ask()` return success with zero protection. An EXISTING TEST (`test_guard_post_check_error_never_breaks_ask`) explicitly requires this — institutionalized, not accidental.
9. **6 test-suite blind spots** where tests assert "was called"/"did not raise" without verifying the claimed effect: `test_denied_write_queues_to_broker` codifies the broker bug (asserts "must NOT raise", never checks the target changed); `test_stream_drain.py` never invokes `_action_ask_inner()` so it structurally cannot catch the exit-code bug; `test_clean_at_dispatch_tracked_auto_reverted` mocks `git checkout`, never verifies file contents were restored; `test_concurrent_race_aborts_revert` tests the wrong race (a write during HEAD lookup, not overlapping ask windows); `test_at1_health_written_before_exit` mocks `_record_ask_failure` and checks it was called, never inspects `health.json`; `test_arbiter_autowire.py` only calls `_maybe_run_arbiter_on_finalize()` directly, never through the real production call sites (`action_consensus_vote()`/broker-drain) — breaking both real integration points would stay green.

## 6. Round 8 — peer_mgr.py, provisioner.py, quota.py, ctx_save/ctx_end.py (Track E — ag)

1. **`peer_mgr.py:_save()` fixed `.tmp` path, no lock** (52-60) — concurrent admin invocations can collide.
2. **`peer_mgr.py` multi-file mutations are non-atomic** — `cmd_suspend()` (3 files) / `cmd_add()` (4 files + peer doc) sequentially save separate registries with no cross-file transaction; a crash mid-sequence leaves `orchestration.json`/`peers.json`/`protocol.json` disagreeing about a peer's state.
3. **Resolved 2026-07-26:** extra archives now download to unique `.part` files, validate length where declared plus a mandatory digest, atomically promote, and pass traversal validation before staged extraction.
4. **Resolved 2026-07-26:** vendor quota ISO timestamps now reject naive values unless the provider supplies an explicit timezone contract; rejection carries diagnostic provenance.
5. **`ctx_end.py:228-231` hangs indefinitely on failure** — calls `input("Press Enter to continue...")` when `claude -p` returns nonzero; hangs any non-interactive/automated/headless invocation. **Elevated priority**: this is a script the user runs directly (CLAUDE.md: "Run ctx-end when done for the day"), not just an internal hub.py mechanism.
6. **`ctx_save.py:114-118` doesn't check subprocess returncode** before unconditionally overwriting `summary_session.md` with the subprocess's stdout — a failed call can destroy an existing session summary with error text or an empty file.

## 7. Round 10 — final action-handler sweep (ag)

1. **Resolved 2026-07-26:** the unconsumed, lockless context acknowledgement API was removed in full (action, CLI, protocol/guard classifications, schema snapshot, and tests). The independent read-only context hash action remains.
2. **`_lease_sweep` silently swallows timezone comparison exceptions** (`hub.py:9502-9523`) — a naive-vs-aware `datetime` comparison raises `TypeError`, caught by a bare `except Exception: pass`, so any lease with a naive-ISO expiry timestamp is NEVER marked expired — a zombie lease that never gets cleaned up.
3. `artifact-claim`/`status`/`finalize`, `discover`, `update-signatures`, `transient-scan` — all LOOKS CORRECT (proper locking, read-only where appropriate, no un-isolated mutation found).

**Round 10 returning mostly-clean results (4 of 6 areas correct) suggested action-handler coverage was approaching complete — Round 11 (§8) found this was premature: `hub_context.py`/`ContextGate` and the commit-time check scripts were untouched territory with a high defect density.**

## 8. Round 11 — `hub_context.py`/ContextGate and commit-time check scripts (cx)

A live governed-mutation-guard incident (Top-5 #2) recurred while this exact document was being extended for this section — the terminal's own prior commit was flagged as "changed during peer ask" and quarantined; verified via `git diff`/`git log` that no actual content was lost (the quarantine action was a no-op against already-committed, unchanged content this time). Second real-time self-demonstration of Top-5 #2 this session.

### ContextGate (`hub_context.py`) — 8 more real bugs

1. **CJK token-estimation formula is wrong** `[live-repro]` — contract says `len / 3.5 × 1.8` (`docs-v2/general/lifecycle.md:379`); implementation uses `len / 2 × 1.8` (`hub_context.py:59`). Probed: 241,778 Hangul characters produced an estimate of 217,600 tokens (triggering `prune`) vs the documented formula's 124,342 — a 75% overestimate.
2. **All `ag.*` profiles are checked against a fabricated 200k context window, not their real one** `[live-repro]` — the consumer only reads `profile_data["model_id"]`, and otherwise falls back to the ROOT peer id `"ag"` (`hub.py:5466`), which isn't a real model id, so it silently receives the 200k unknown-model default (`hub_context.py:117`). Probed: `ag.standard`/`ag.effort`/`ag.deepthink`/`ag.opus`/`ag.gptoss` ALL reached ContextGate as model `"ag"` with a 200,000 limit, even though the first three declare 1,048,576 and `ag.opus` links to a 1M registry entry. This means ContextGate has likely been silently over-pruning/rejecting ag work this entire session (and before) against a limit 5x smaller than reality. `ag.gptoss`'s true ceiling remains genuinely `[TEST NEEDED]` (only an 8k proven lower bound exists).
3. **Malformed/missing registry data silently becomes a guessed 200k capacity** `[live-repro]` — `_load_json()` swallows every error (`hub_context.py:97`), contradicting the registry's own "unknown values are omitted, never inferred" policy. The CLI default model name (`hub_context.py:209`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`) is also stale/absent from the live registry.
4. **The static context failover chain cannot actually fit the overflow it's meant to handle** `[live-repro]` — the only live mapping routes Sonnet 5 (1M context) to Haiku (200k context); a query near the Sonnet failover threshold (~950k) is therefore rejected by Haiku too. Worse, the failover function returns a bare model SLUG where the recursive caller expects a routable node/profile (`hub.py:5484`, `5520`). Probed: a 950k-token estimate returned `failover → claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, which is neither a node nor an alias, then `reject`.
5. **Constructor-injected registry doesn't actually govern failover** `[live-repro]` — `ContextGate(registry_path=...)` loads the given registry for capacity lookups, but `_FAILOVER_CHAIN` is loaded from the DEFAULT file at import time, module-globally (`hub_context.py:31,45`) — the injected registry is ignored for failover decisions. Probed: an instance pointed at an empty-models registry still returned the live Sonnet→Haiku chain.
6. **Failover telemetry always reports 0% utilization** — `ContextGate` returns a field called `utilization` (`hub_context.py:142`), but the failover logger reads a nonexistent `ratio` field instead (`hub.py:5515`) — always absent, so utilization silently logs as 0%. The one integration test that touches this MOCKS `ratio` directly, masking the mismatch (`test_hub_integration_v42.py:116`).
7. **Configured thresholds are misreported in the actual error/output text** — `ContextGateError`'s message hardcodes "95%" (`hub_context.py:71`) regardless of the real configured `failover_pct`. Probed: with a configured 50% threshold, limit 100, estimate 60, the raised exception literally said "60 exceeds 95" — the wrong number, in an error message a human might read while debugging. CLI rejection output also omits `utilization` entirely (`hub_context.py:224`), printing e.g. `190,000 tokens (0.0%)`.
8. **Resolved 2026-07-26:** ContextGate traceability now points to `general/lifecycle.md` and the real C2/C3 ContextGate test modules.

LOOKS CORRECT: raw threshold arithmetic itself, once given a correct model capacity, is right (272,000→warn 217,600/failover 258,400/prune 204,000; 1,000,000→800,000/950,000/750,000). One cosmetic boundary issue: pruning accepts exactly 75% despite the contract saying "below" 75%.

### Commit-time check scripts (`_sys/checks/`, the pre-commit hook gate) — 7 more real bugs

1. **CHK-01/CHK-02, CHK-CONST, and CHK-LEDGER validate the WORKING TREE, not the staged commit** — `.git/hooks/pre-commit:3,23,36` invoke them directly; their implementations use ordinary `Path.read_text()`/`rglob()` (`check_policy_constants.py:54`, `check_policy_ledger.py:70`) rather than reading the staged git blob. This means a staged violation can be masked by restoring only the worktree copy from HEAD after staging — the checks see clean content while git commits the bad staged blob. (cx did not execute this reproduction live, to avoid disturbing the user's real index — flagged as a real, demonstrated-by-code-reading defect, not independently probed.) `CHK-ENC` correctly reads staged blobs and does NOT share this defect.
2. **`check_docs_mece` (CHK-01) misses ordinary Markdown-link syntax**, only recognizing backtick-quoted paths (`check_docs_mece.py:34`). Probed: `[broken](_sys/ai/does-not-exist.json)` produced no match while the backtick form did. CHK-04 compounds this by resolving cross-file paths relative to the docs root instead of the current document, while assuming CHK-01 already covers missing targets.
3. **CHK-02's INV-19 (Korean-language-in-internal-artifacts) guard only scans `*.md`**, despite listing `core`/`checks`/`ai` as in-scope directories (`check_docs_mece.py:192`). Probed: CHK-02 returned zero findings while cx found 7 real Python files containing Hangul code points in those directories, including non-console changelog/docstring content.
4. **CHK-03 checks stale `HEAD` (not the pending commit) and fails open** — runs `git log ... -1 HEAD` (`check_docs_mece.py:215`), ignores nonzero git exit codes, and returns "clean" on any exception; its own test explicitly codifies this fail-open behavior as correct (`test_check_docs_mece.py:243`). It's also absent from the actual pre-commit hook and outside the configured `fail_on` list — the Doc-as-Code co-change rule it implements is advisory/post-hoc only, not real commit-time enforcement.
5. **CHK-CONST is a bare substring check, not a real assignment-provenance check** — passes whenever the RHS text anywhere contains the literal string `telemetry_config()` (`check_policy_constants.py:56`). Probed: 5 constants all written as `NAME = 123  # telemetry_config()` (a comment, not a real function call) returned zero violations. Also only inspects the FIRST match, so a later hardcoded reassignment of the same name is invisible.
6. **CHK-LEDGER permits evidence-free checks** — a `text_contains` policy-decision check with a missing `expected_substring` field defaults to `""`, and the empty string is a substring of every file, so the check always silently passes (`check_policy_ledger.py:82`). Probed directly.
7. **A real, currently-live enforcement gap**: the Engram Refactor Blueprint's own documented requirement — that CHK-LEDGER verify both its SHELVED banner AND the "evaluate activation gate" backlog item (`engram-refactor-blueprint-2026-07-20.md:51`) — is only half-implemented: the live ledger checks the banner and merely checks that the blueprint is *mentioned* in `00-MANIFEST.md` (`policy-decisions.json:107`), not that the specific backlog item still exists. Deleting that backlog item today would leave CHK-LEDGER green.

LOOKS CORRECT: malformed CHK-CONST/CHK-LEDGER JSON, or a missing referenced path, both fail closed as intended. All 3 live CLIs currently exit 0 in normal operation — the false-negative paths above require a specific evasion pattern to trigger, not everyday use.

**cx's explicit verdict closing this round**: "Because this round produced consequential new findings, the exhaustive ROI gate is not met; I would not declare EXHAUSTIVE_COMPLETE." Treat prior coverage-complete signals (end of §7) as provisional, not final.

## Fixes: designed, and now mostly applied (unanimous convergence, ag + cx, 3+ rounds of mutual adversarial revision each)

These bugs (Top-5 #3, #4, #5, plus the health-gate fix — the arbiter, handoff, classification, and health-gate bugs) have committable-quality fix designs, including edge-case handling, regression test tables, and honest risk assessment, and **4 of them are now APPLIED, real-tested, and cross-verified** (see the Top-5 table's Fix status column for exact commits). Summary:

- **Broker (Top-5 #1) — DESIGNED, NOT APPLIED**: delete `_try_broker_fallback()` entirely (a synchronous write must commit or raise, never silently queue); explicit `broker-submit` becomes a real CAS operation (SHA-256 `expected_revision` of raw file bytes, `.ready` marker for crash-safe publication); broker-drain uses the SAME lock name as direct writers via a new `_mutation_lock_resource()` mapping table. Flagged "High" fix risk — deliberately makes previously-hidden sandbox failures visible. Also found `_normalize_runtime_files()` and `action_thread_promote()` need the same lock-unification fix. This is the natural next fix to pick up.
- **Arbiter override (Top-5 #3) — APPLIED (`feb7d22`)**: `_apply_arbiter_override_to_round()` under a per-round lock, refusing to touch `finalized`/`unanimous` rounds, validating `round_id` match and `authority == "override"`, requiring a strict first-line `VERDICT: APPROVE|REJECT` parse (loosened prefix-matching was rejected after cx found it could misparse). Ships with the required companion fix to `_real_arbiter_invoker()` (now checks the arbiter subprocess's own return code) and an explicit output-contract instruction in `condense_arbiter_input()`. A SEPARATE duplicate-invocation race (direct-vote vs broker-merge paths could each independently finalize+invoke) was found and fixed during implementation verification, not in the original design — `_apply_vote_merge` now shares the same `consensus_{round_id}` lock, and `_maybe_run_arbiter_on_finalize` atomically claims the round before invoking. Verified with real separate-process race tests, not just threading.
- **Handoff race (Top-5 #4) — APPLIED (`28b4d67`)**: acquires the existing `"handoff"` lock BEFORE the file-existence check, not just around the read/write. Verified with a live 2-process concurrency test.
- **Error classification (Top-5 #5) — APPLIED (`28b4d67`)**: reorders to check sandbox/spawn and cli-not-found FIRST, adds dedicated `model_error`/`session_invalid` categories (critical: does NOT fold "model/session not found" into the transient `rate_or_session_limit` bucket, avoiding unbounded auto-retry churn), narrows all needles to word-boundary regexes with proper context requirements. Verified against 10 real test strings.
- **Health-gate fix — APPLIED (`28b4d67`)**: centralizes the profile-gate check inside `_peer_effective_health()` using the EXISTING `profile_health_gate_open()` SSOT helper (not a raw `gate_open is False` read, which would reintroduce the cooldown-expiry race). Verified with 5+ cases including the exact race scenario.

**Still no fix design at all**: Top-5 #2 (governed-mutation guard concurrency) — the highest-severity CONFIRMED-unfixed item, demonstrated 3 separate times this session (twice against this very document's own file writes). No design round has happened for this one yet; it needs the same treatment the other 5 got (independent design proposal → cross-review → real-test → apply).

## 9. Round 12 — live confirmation + `peer_console.py`/`quota.py` (cx, fresh reset-credit-funded quota)

**Live confirmation of the ag.* fabricated-context-window bug (§8):** a non-mutating in-process probe through the REAL `action_ask()` call chain — a genuine `ag.standard` dispatch with a routine 4-token prompt, stopped before spawning the actual `agy` process — observed:
```json
{"resolved_profile_id": "ag.standard", "model_id_received_by_ContextGate": "ag", "context_limit_used": 200000}
```
against a real configured `runtime_context_window` of `1,048,576` (`orchestration.json:228`). This confirms the bug is live in the actual production dispatch path, not just reachable through a hand-constructed call to `ContextGate` in isolation.

**5 more real bugs, `_sys/cli/peer_console.py` and `_sys/core/quota.py`:**

1. **Codex `exec`/`review`/`resume` subcommands bypass console security defaults** — `peer_console.py:187` returns before adding workspace-write/profile defaults for these subcommands (`_CODEX_COMMANDS` includes them, but they're treated like plain administrative subcommands). Probed: `["exec", "Reply with OK"]` and `["resume", "--last"]` both passed through completely unchanged. Live `codex --help` confirms both commands genuinely accept sandbox/model flags, so this isn't an unavoidable CLI limitation — the defaults are just never applied.
2. **`apply_security_semantics()` has zero production callers** (`peer_console.py:109`) — a repository-wide search found only its own definition and its unit tests. The documented declarative `security_contract.sandbox_semantics` layer does not actually drive any runtime behavior; real console execution still uses hardcoded per-peer branches instead. Same "designed but never wired up" pattern as the arbiter override (§1.3) and `context-ack` (§7.1).
3. **The profile banner can report a model that isn't actually being launched** (`peer_console.py:36`) — it only accepts `peer_id`, not the actual computed argv; callers like `codex_entry.py:89` never pass the real argv through. Probed: launching with `--model custom-model` still showed the banner `cx.effort / gpt-5.6-terra`. Also incorrectly appears for profile-free commands like `login`.
4. **`_append_missing()` mishandles a flag already present positionally** (`peer_console.py:97`) — it pairs flags token-by-token; if `"workspace-write"` already appears as a positional value, it emits a bare orphaned `-s` flag with no value. Probed: produced `["workspace-write", "-s", "--model", ...]`, an invalid sandbox argument pair.
5. **Resolved 2026-07-26:** duration conversion is inside defensive validation, and pacing rejects booleans, non-numeric values, NaN, infinity, and invalid ranges with a machine-readable unknown-input reason.

**Existing test gap identified**: the current console-wrapper parity test only calls `peer_default_args(peer_id, [])` — an empty argv — which is exactly why the subcommand-bypass (#1) and positional-flag-collision (#4) defects above have stayed green.

Running total after 12 rounds: **47 real bugs found.**

## Methodology notes worth preserving

- Every "final" claim from a single peer in this audit was cross-reviewed at least once; several were caught overstating (ag idealizing target architecture as current behavior, twice; a too-narrow `ProcessIOMode` enum; a too-loose arbiter verdict parser; folding not-found errors into the wrong category) and corrected before being accepted.
- The terminal (cc) independently spot-verified 5+ claims directly against live source rather than trusting peer reports at face value — all confirmed accurate. One adjacent lesson from this session: a peer (ag) fabricated 6 plausible-looking external GitHub issue citations when asked to web-search for known bugs in a DIFFERENT task earlier this session — caught by direct `WebFetch` verification. That incident does not appear to apply to this audit (no external citations were used here, only live source/probes), but it's the reason several claims above were independently re-verified rather than taken on trust.
- **Operational lesson from writing this document itself**: never write to a governed path while a peer `ask` is in flight — even an unrelated peer working on an unrelated task can trigger the guard's misattribution bug against the terminal's own concurrent edit. Verify no `ask` is in-flight (or accept the file may need re-writing) before saving governed docs going forward, until Top-5 #2 is actually fixed.
