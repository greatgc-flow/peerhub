## MUST DO (INV)

### Consensus & Execution
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| INV-01 | No execution before consensus. `FINALIZED` check mandatory at COLLAB_RATE ≥ 3. |
| INV-02 | At COLLAB_RATE ≥ 8: Final Call required — "Any additional feedback?" → all peers ACK before proceeding. |
| INV-03 | At COLLAB_RATE = 10: offline peer auto-abstain does NOT satisfy unanimity. Human override required. |
| INV-04 | All consensus decisions recorded in `handoff.md [CONSENSUS_HISTORY]`. |

### Session & Context
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| INV-05 | Every peer entry MUST run: `init-session → health-update GREEN → context-fill → check mailbox`. |
| INV-06 | Re-orientation (read handoff.md) mandatory before any work in a new session. |
| INV-07 | If skipping re-orientation (no prior session): state explicitly `[SKIPPED: no prior session found]`. |

### Health & Routing
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| INV-08 | Health checks are zero-token (local `health.json` reads only — never model calls). |
| INV-09 | Every peer ask outcome (exit code, stderr) MUST be classified via `_record_ask_success/failure()`. |
| INV-10 | Before routing work to a peer, `health-precheck` must pass (GREEN or YELLOW, gate_open=true). |
| INV-11 | RED recovery MUST use `peer-recover` — NOT manual `health-update --status GREEN`. |

### Permissions & Security
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| INV-12 | All peers run with minimum non-interactive permissions (DIR-002). See `general/permissions.md`. |
| INV-13 | Permission parity between the live `hub_peer.py` adapter command and `peer_console.py` MUST be verified via `profile-validate`. |
| INV-14 | Session fingerprint MUST be checked on resume. Drift → retire session → fresh start. |

### Error Handling
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| INV-15 | Same error repeats `failure_error` times (default 5, see `protocol.json["health"]`) → HALT, consult peers. |
| INV-16 | P0/P1 errors escalated to Human Gate MUST include: Root Cause · System Impact · Actionable Remediation. |

### Directives & Communication
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| INV-17 | All communication within a room is shared with all participating nodes (no private channels). |
| INV-18 | Active runtime directives injected into every peer ask. Peers MUST treat as standing operational context. |
| INV-19 | All internal content (IPC queries, docs-v2 documents, source code, commit messages, proposals) MUST be written in English. Exception: console output delivered directly to the human user MAY be in Korean. Rationale: CJK tokens cost 2–7× more than ASCII — internal English reduces per-session token spend by ~40%. |

### Hub Governance & Peer Routing (D-01g~D-08g)
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| INV-20 | Recovery Journal: Hub operations must journal intent to `operations.jsonl` (append-only), atomically replace affected state (via `os.replace`), then journal commit. This guarantees consistency across non-ACID filesystems. |
| INV-21 | Challenge Window: Leader claims must remain pending during a challenge window (default 60s) to allow other peers to challenge. |
| INV-22 | Term Limits: Coordinator claims must be rejected by the hub if a single peer has held coordinator role for 3 consecutive terms. |
| INV-23 | Stable Fingerprint: Session fingerprints must only hash normative compatibility fields, excluding environment-specific paths. |
| INV-24 | Declaration Priority: Local routing/classification inferences must not override explicit `peer.profile` declarations. |
| INV-25 | 5-Layer Evidence: Routing decisions must evaluate all 5 evidence layers (Explicit metadata, Semantic markers, Request shape, Multilingual shape, Runtime feedback) and record justification in `routing_metrics.jsonl`. Not all layers are required to provide positive evidence; absence is valid input. |
| INV-26 | Hub-Enforced Policy: Governance rules (including COLLAB_RATE and consensus verification) must be enforced programmatically by `hub.py`, not left to peer self-discipline. |
| INV-27 | Relay Fidelity: Inter-peer message routing must guarantee lossless transcription and zero semantic modification of payloads. |
| INV-28 | Quorum Authority: Active consensus rounds require quorum = `max(2, f(N, risk))` where N is the count of gate-OPEN eligible voters at round-start, and f is a risk-adjusted function (undefined above N=3; default to N). At least one non-proposing voter from a distinct failure domain must actively `agree`. Proposer MUST NOT self-finalize. |
| INV-29 | General-to-Specific Dispatch: general/core dispatch MUST NOT branch on peer identity. All peer-specific behavior MUST live behind the adapter, transport, or declared-capability interface in the specific layer. This preserves the general→specific dependency direction. Enforced by `test_general_core_dispatch_has_no_peer_identity_branches`. |

## MUST NOT (PRO)

### Permission Prohibitions
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| PRO-01 | NEVER pass raw user shell text as executable/flag fragments (injection risk). |
| PRO-02 | NEVER grant root, SYSTEM, or admin elevation to any peer subprocess. |
| PRO-03 | NEVER use bypass/full-danger flags (`yolo`, `dangerously-bypass-*`) in hub-managed asks. |
| PRO-04 | NEVER resume a peer session without first verifying session fingerprint compatibility. |
| PRO-05 | NEVER hardcode credentials into peer invocation arguments or environment variables. |

### Routing Prohibitions
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| PRO-06 | NEVER route asks to RED or gate-closed peers hoping they will self-heal. |
| PRO-07 | NEVER infer peer health from prose content — only from transport signals (exit code, stderr markers). |
| PRO-08 | NEVER send a dedicated model ping just to check health (wastes tokens). |

### Directive Prohibitions
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| PRO-09 | NEVER write auto-generated rules into `user-directives.md` — that muddies human authority. |
| PRO-10 | NEVER inject directive content that is user-shell-injectable. |
| PRO-11 | NEVER skip injection for a peer claiming "it already knows" — every peer gets full context. |

### Governance Prohibitions
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| PRO-12 | NEVER modify `CLAUDE.md`, `PROTOCOL.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `protocol.json`, or `hub.py` without R:10 unanimous consensus (all active voters in `protocol.json["consensus"]["r10_voters"]`). |
| PRO-13 | NEVER access Security/Auth files (`auth`, USERPROFILE area) from any AI peer. |
| PRO-14 | NEVER let a stale coordinator keep task ownership without a checkpoint. |

### Language & Communication
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| PRO-16 | NEVER write IPC query files, proposals, or peer-to-peer messages in Korean. Always English. (INV-19 enforcement) |

### ag-Specific (Temporary)
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| PRO-15 | ag requires the PTY adapter on Windows. Governance equality is independent of adapter-specific permission flags; DIR-002 remains authoritative. |

### Effect Surface Prohibitions (D-02g, D-06g)
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| PRO-17 | NEVER allow writing side-effects to files or executing commands on target peers during inter-peer routing unless explicitly authorized by a governance write profile. |
| PRO-18 | NEVER violate 5-channel effect surface isolation (no local temp write, no governance write, no workspace write, no process mutation, no external I/O) when executing under the `--read-only` flag. |

### Transport-Role Enforcement (PRO-19)
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| PRO-19 | NEVER allow the terminal/router peer to mutate governance or room state — consensus rounds/votes, `handoff.md`, leader/coordinator claims, directives, `protocol.json`, or any `_sys/` artifact. The terminal is a **mechanical transport**: it relays asks and routes to worker peers; it is NOT an author, voter, or coordinator. All state mutation MUST be performed by an identified worker peer through a governance-write profile. Tier-0 human authority is unaffected (human override remains supreme, INV-03). |

> **PRO-19 implementation status (ENFORCED).** ENFORCED for mutating_hub_actions; read-only asks/consultation exempt regardless of tier. Programmatically enforced in `hub.py`: mutations are blocked for `terminal` origin, read-only asks and consultations are explicitly exempt regardless of tier, and `--force-tier0` provides the required Tier-0 human override (INV-03). The three intended controls are active: (1) `HUB_ORIGIN=terminal` callers are blocked from all `mutating_hub_actions` (PRO-19/C1); (2) `decision_tier_floor` requires at least `effort` tier for governance mutations (PRO-19/C2); (3) system-automated actions (sweeps, health checks, session lifecycle) are explicitly exempted (PRO-19/C3).

> **PRO-19 analysis-boundary clause (GAP-1, 2026-06-26).** Extends PRO-19 from *state mutation* to *cognitive role*: the human-interface terminal may **frame, route, relay, and summarize** worker outputs, but MUST NOT perform substantive task analysis once a worker is selected (it must not pre-analyze/re-frame the request in a way that biases the worker — enrichment, not analysis). "Coordinator"/"leader" is a **task role assigned by protocol** (see `general/routing.md §3` leader election), NOT an authority the terminal self-assumes. Owner: this index + `general/protocol.md §1.2`.

> **PRO-19 direct-file-write clause (GAP-2, 2026-07-07).** Closes the gap where a terminal edits `_sys/` files with its **own** file-write tool (not a `mutating_hub_action`, so `hub.py` origin-blocking did not fire). Controls: (1) `protocol.json → decision_tier_floor.terminal_file_write_min_tier = "effort"` — a `*.standard`/low-tier terminal is a thin router only and MUST delegate edits to an effort+ peer that applies them via encoding-safe `Write`; (2) `leader_election.human_interface_peer = "cc"` (honored only within `human_interface_peer_freshness_minutes`; a stale terminal identity re-elects); (3) mechanical backstop `check_encoding.py` (CHK-ENC) in the pre-commit hook catches UTF-8/mojibake corruption before it lands, regardless of author. Trigger incident: `cx.standard` (gpt-5.4-mini, low tier) as terminal re-saved `docs-v2/*.md` and destroyed all non-ASCII into `?`. Owner: this index + `ops/logging.md`.

### Peer Equality & Multi-Terminal (INV-30)
| ID | Rule |
|----|------|
| INV-30 | **Peer Equality & Multi-Terminal:** the terminal/router role is a profile+origin property, not a fixed peer identity. All peers (cc, ag, cx, gc) are equal; any may assume the active human-interface terminal role. All topological enforcement, tier floors, and escalation must be peer-agnostic and symmetric; escalation prioritizes the active terminal's own worker tier or routes dynamically, never hardcoding a peer. |
| INV-31 | **Proactive Peer Collaboration:** All active peers MUST proactively collaborate without explicit human prompting. If a task involves high complexity, architectural decisions, MECE validation, or resolving edge cases, the active peer MUST autonomously invoke/consult other peers (cc, ag, cx) to achieve cross-verified consensus before finalizing the output. |
