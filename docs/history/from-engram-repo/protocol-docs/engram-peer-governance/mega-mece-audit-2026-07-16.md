# Overnight Mega-Audit — 2026-07-16

Five parallel tracks, all peers (cx.effort/deepthink, ag.effort/deepthink, cc.fable) engaged, one continuous session. Read-only investigation + one uncompromising multi-round debate; no code/config was changed by this audit — this doc is the input to a follow-up implementation pass.

## Meta-finding (spans all 5 tracks)

The dominant recurring defect class, independently rediscovered in every track, is **declared-but-unenforced drift**: a config knob, doc claim, or backlog entry describes behavior that the code does not actually implement (or implements differently). Every existing check (`check_config.py`, `check_docs_mece.py`, `check_backlog.py --freshness`) validates SHAPE/EXISTENCE, never SEMANTIC TRUTH against live code — so this class of defect is structurally invisible to CI and only surfaces via a full manual audit like this one. Track 2 (cx.deepthink) found this pattern is not confined to docs — it reaches into **live routing/dispatch code** (see T2-1 below, an actual production bug, not just a stale comment).

---

## Track 1 — Docs/source/config MECE audit (3-peer, 2 rounds)

Closed at Round 2 (diminishing but non-zero marginal find rate; folded into the larger effort rather than spinning a Round 3). Full finding set: 21 (Round 1) + 8 (Round 2) = 29, one retracted as a false positive after direct code verification (B5: `hub.py:5030-5074`'s "non-fatal" comment does NOT contradict lifecycle.md — it scopes to a different exception branch than the reject-path `sys.exit(1)`, which does match the doc).

Highlights:
- **Two distinct `CLAUDE.md` files exist** — `P:\CLAUDE.md` (root, stale session-handoff snapshot, last touched 2026-07-05, 11+ days/dozens of commits behind) vs `_sys/claude/config/CLAUDE.md` (global prefs, loaded every session). The root one still lists `backlog_reorg_2026_07_04.md` as master SSOT and frames D1 as "older banked backlog" — both superseded. This gap in the audit's own original domain-scoping was itself only caught in Round 2.
- `check_docs_mece.py` iterates `_DOCS_DIR.rglob("*.md")` only — **every** MECE check (CHK-01/04/05/07), not just one, is structurally blind to both CLAUDE.md files and README.md.
- `gc` is listed as an active/equal peer in the global CLAUDE.md (lines 38, 101) while `docs-v2/specific/gc.md` says `SUSPENDED TOMBSTONE` since 2026-06-25.
- `learning.md` describes a "Three-Layer Architecture" citing two knowledge files that don't exist on disk.
- Backlog `next_action` text-hygiene bug confirmed systemic (not isolated): T44, T47, and the earlier A12 all show a "DONE ..." summary prepended without removing the original pre-completion prose, creating an apparent self-contradiction on literal read (evidence_commit/git history is accurate in all cases). Spot-checked T42/T52/T53 clean — not universal, but recurring enough to need a hygiene pass.
- `schemas.md` marked "ACTIVE v2" but its sample uses `gpt-5.4-mini`, superseded by `gpt-5.6-luna`.
- `manual.md` never mentions Token-Load-Balancing or the Final Arbiter — both are live, activated systems.

## Track 2 — Peer/model/profile/session management MECE review (cx + ag, split by domain)

### cx.deepthink — routing/profile/model declaration domain (10 findings, all file:line + 5-Whys)

1. **HIGH — live bug, not just docs drift.** Automatic context-gate failover (`hub.py:5047-5059` → `_snapshot_failover_choice()` → `snapshot_failover_target()` at `hub.py:2708-2730`) picks the first eligible **raw-headroom** row (`snapshot.py:1756-1768`) and never receives `routing-config.json`, so it bypasses `arbiter_models` exclusion, reserve clamps, pacing, cost, and terminal exclusion — all of which the normal AUTO path (`select_load_balanced_peer`, `snapshot.py:1914-2122`) enforces correctly. Live proof: `diag` currently names `cc.deepthink` as `NEXT FAILOVER TARGET` even though it's in `arbiter_models` and should never be an automatic bulk target.
2. **HIGH** — `failure_promotion` config (`routing-config.json:75-90`) is unreachable: the router only matches `quality_failure`/`test_failure`/`reasoning_failure`, but the actual failure classifier (`_classify_ask_failure()`, `hub.py:1700-1759`) only ever emits transport/runtime reasons (`auth_error`, `fatal_error`, etc.). `max_tier_increase`, `promotion_resets_on_success`, `fallback.direction/all_blocked/cross_peer_change`, `scope`, `explicit_profile_policy` are all ORPHANED — hardcoded elsewhere or never read.
3. **MEDIUM** — the `effort_score` threshold is only partially authoritative: its medium-score branch falls through to `ambiguous_default` (`hub_profile_router.py:166-178`), so most routing decisions are driven by the default, not the threshold. Empirically probed live.
4. **HIGH** — token-load-balancer: `select="seeded_weighted_random"` knob is ORPHANED (selection is hardcoded, `snapshot.py:2136-2150`); the "live in-flight deductions" doc claim is false in production (`inflight` param never passed at the real call sites, always `{}`); `cost_map` is mischaracterized as a mere "tie-break" when it actually continuously reweights every candidate (`snapshot.py:2058-2062`).
5. **MEDIUM** — shadow routing resolves the terminal identity via a stale helper (`_fresh_active_coordinator()`) different from the live driving path's resolver, corrupting shadow-mode evidence (does not affect real dispatch).
6. **HIGH** — of 3 configured arbiter triggers (`dissent`, `high_risk`, `r10_final`), only `dissent` is reachable — `detect_dissent()` can never classify a round as `high_risk`/`r10_final`. `authority` config key is also ORPHANED (hardcoded elsewhere).
7. **HIGH** — most of `protocol.json`'s declared policy is pure decoration: all 7 `workload.routing_rules` entries are ORPHANED (nothing reads them); of `collab_rate`, only `current` and two review-interval fields are actually consumed; `risk_table`, `r10_semantics`, `zero_token_allowlist`, `operation_classes`, `action_policy`, etc. have zero Python consumers. R:10 unanimity is hardcoded separately (`hub.py:6024-6034`) from the declared `requires_unanimous` field.
8. **MEDIUM** — the 4 advertised session-policy modes (`auto/reuse/fresh/none`) collapse to 2 live behaviors today, because every current peer declares `session_mode="reuse"`, making `auto==reuse` and `fresh==none` universally.
9. **LOW** — profile declarations are mechanically correct but comments/docs actively contradict them (`ag.opus` mislabeled "arbiter/escalation" in a comment despite the same file correctly excluding it two lines later; `routing.md` self-contradicts on the ambiguous-default profile between lines 30 and 44).
10. Confirms a wide baseline of config IS correctly wired — the audit found real gaps, not universal breakage.

### ag.effort — session/lease lifecycle domain

- **Session reuse (context_affinity) is genuinely wired and measurably exercised** — verified via real `session_state.json` entries showing multi-day reuse across turns, not just a code path that exists unused.
- All 5 `LEASE_STATE` values (open/closed/failed/timeout/expired) are reachable and distinct from real execution outcomes.
- **`SOURCE_STALE` 300s threshold is under-calibrated** (`snapshot.py:657`): real successful heavy-reasoning turns take up to 476s+, so the 5-minute staleness threshold false-triggers routinely on normal operation — independently corroborates what this very session's own `diag` output showed (613s/387s stale warnings on ag/cx while both were actively working).
- **Orphaned session-directory leak**: `.ai/sessions/` accumulates dead room folders (`room-26ab`, `room-8aad`, etc.) forever — `_retire_session` prunes the in-memory history list but never deletes the on-disk directory, and `scrubber.py` explicitly preserves `sessions/` until Tier-4 ZeroBase.

---

## Track 3 — Why is cc usage/cost high (self-investigated)

1. **Confirmed bug**: cc.fable's "147% over capacity" CRIT alert in `diag`'s ATTENTION section is a false positive. It fires off ANY historical session row with `utilization_pct > 100` (`diag.py:1161-1166`, no recency/active-only filter), and the triggering row is a 4-day-stale CLOSED session whose stored 200k denominator doesn't match the CURRENT `model-registry.json` declaration of `claude-fable-5` at 1,000,000 context (`model-registry.json:14-22`). Re-derived against the current registry: 294k/1M = 29%, not over capacity at all.
2. The $77.68 COST figure and cx/ag's "-" are not comparable units (metered $ vs subscription %) — not evidence of imbalance by itself, and is almost certainly scoped to this one unusually large session.
3. `C-7D` pacing at 2.25x is real but is not a routing bug (cc isn't dispatched-to by the hub) — it's workload-driven, largely by this very audit's own direct investigation work.

---

## Track 4/5 — uncompromising debate: quota-dependency display + pacing<=1.0 (5-way, 2 rounds, FULLY CONVERGED)

Participants: cx.effort, cx.deepthink, ag.effort, ag.deepthink, cc.fable. Round A = 5 independent blind proposals; Round B = cross-critique against a shared summary, explicitly barred from silently restating Round A. Convergence reached — no unresolved dissent remains.

### Q1 — Display design (near-unanimous from Round A, fully aligned after Round B)

**Converged rule**: group same-pool time-windows (e.g. a peer's own 5H/7D) onto one line/block; compute a real **time-to-exhaustion** (not a pacing/usage heuristic) and foreground whichever bucket actually projects to exhaust before its reset; demote the rest to a parenthetical/secondary. Genuinely separate pools a peer draws from (ag's `G-*` Gemini vs `3P-*` opus/gptoss) stay as separate line-groups — never collapsed together. When a bucket can't be computed from machine-observed inputs, render `absent`/`binding absent` — never guess (DIR-004).

**Reference formula** (converged around cx.deepthink/cc.fable's version):
```
eta_full = (1 - used_frac) * window_hours / pacing_ratio       # or equivalently from elapsed_seconds
binding  = the bucket in a pool-group with the smallest eta_full, but ONLY if eta_full < time_until_reset
         else label the group "SAFE" / "NO BINDING IN WINDOW", still show the highest-pacing bucket as primary
```

**Reference render** (from live 2026-07-16 data):
```
CC   [OK]  ctx 74k/1M 7%
  ↳ C-pool   🔴 BINDS: 7D 35% 2.25x → empty ~07/18   (5H 20% 0.55x 🟢, resets 3h11m)
AG   [OK]  ctx 119k/1M 9%
  ↳ 3P-pool  🔴 BINDS: 5H 95% 10.42x → empty <1h      (7D absent — not measured, do not guess)
  ↳ G-pool   🟢 SAFE  5H 10% 1.05x, 7D 47% 0.75x — neither binds before reset
CX   [OK]  ctx 120k/258k 46%
  ↳ X-pool   🔴 BINDS: 7D 68% 6.29x → empty before reset
```

**Implementation** (all 5 proposals point to the same functions, so this is low-risk to land): add a pure `time_to_exhaustion()` / `eta_full()` helper next to `calculate_pacing()` in `_sys/core/quota.py` (~after line 56) so the math is SSOT, not duplicated in the renderer. Add `_quota_dependency_groups()` / `_binding_bucket()` in `_sys/cli/diag.py` beside `_quota_display_sort_key()` (~line 314). Replace the flat per-bucket loop in `render_summary()` (~lines 340-350) AND `_live_quota_pool_rows()`/`_live_quota_pool_line()` (~lines 719-748) with the same grouped-render call, so SUMMARY and `--live` cannot drift apart from each other (a recurring failure mode this project has hit before).

### Q2 — Pacing ≤ 1.0 enforcement (converged after Round B; two points were contested in Round A, both resolved)

**Converged final design:**

1. **Hard admission gate, default cap = 1.0, applies to AUTO *and* explicit `--to` asks alike** (all 5 ended here after Round B — no exemption for "explicit means deliberate"; the 2026-07-15 incident's own root cause was explicit asks bypassing balancing, so leaving explicit uncapped just reopens the same hole under a different name).
2. **A single human-only "break-glass" override**, e.g. `--force-pacing <reason>`:
   - Available **only** to a genuine human-terminal-origin ask (distinguished today via the existing `HUB_ORIGIN`/PRO-19 mechanism).
   - **Never** available to system-automated explicit callers, worker/IPC relays, or arbiter auto-wiring — closing the loophole where an autonomous agent just learns to always append the flag (explicitly raised by cc.fable as a new Round-B argument: "a warning shown to an AI relay is not a warning delivered to a human").
   - Every use is logged as a high-severity routing-metrics event (`pacing_override_explicit` / `pacing_cap_override`).
3. **No profile-class exemption for premium/manual_only/arbiter profiles** (`cc.fable`, `cc.deepthink`, `ag.opus`) — unanimous, with CC's own live `C-7D` 2.25x CRIT bucket cited by 4 of 5 peers as the direct counter-proof that "premium" doesn't mean "separate budget."
4. **Narrow, budget-bounded last-resort carve-out for genuine DIR-005 arbiter triggers only** (this was the one real Round-A disagreement — ag.effort alone proposed a blanket premium exemption; converged via Round B to a much narrower version everyone accepted): an over-cap premium/arbiter profile may fire **only** when (i) a real DIR-005 dissent/high_risk trigger is active, (ii) every other candidate in the `arbiter_models` fallback chain is also blocked/ineligible (cascade through alternate-pool arbiters first, e.g. try `ag.opus` before conceding `cc.fable` is needed), and (iii) the spend is logged as `pacing_cap_override` and counted against the existing 5-per-5h arbiter budget — not a free pass, a last-resort valve with the same audit trail as the human break-glass.
5. **False-positive guard**: enforcement only activates once `elapsed_frac` clears the existing 0.05 smoothing floor by a margin (proposals ranged 0.10-0.15) AND `used_frac` clears a small floor (~0.05-0.15) — a 10x ratio two minutes into a window with 2% used warns but never blocks. Two independent fresh observations of the same breach (not one single reading) before hard-enforcing, per cx.effort/cx.deepthink, to avoid a single noisy sample triggering a block.

**Implementation** (converged pointers): extend `calculate_pacing()` in `quota.py:29` to also return raw `elapsed_frac`; add a pure `pacing_admission_for_profile()` / `evaluate_pacing_admission()` near `_profile_pacing_max()` in `snapshot.py:1265`; filter candidates in `select_load_balanced_peer()` before weight aggregation (`snapshot.py` ~2021-2071); apply the same predicate inside `select_arbiter()` (`snapshot.py:2184`/1836) with the cascade-then-carve-out behavior from point 4; re-check immediately before spawn in `hub.py::_action_ask_inner()` (~4931-4989) so explicit-target and any telemetry-race bypass is closed too; add a `token_load_balancing.pacing_hard_gate = {enabled: true, max_ratio: 1.0, unknown_policy: "deny", confirmation_count: 2}` block to `routing-config.json`, with `unknown_policy: deny` (an unmeasured profile is never assumed safe, per DIR-004) — this is a **new**, currently-absent knob, not a repeat of the Track-2 "orphaned config" pattern, since it's being proposed together with its enforcement call sites.

---

## Proposed action plan (NOT yet implemented — for review)

Ordered by ratio of (confidence × blast-radius-if-wrong) to (effort):

**P0 — safe, high-confidence, single-file fixes:**
- Track2-cx#1: stop `snapshot_failover_target()` from bypassing `arbiter_models`/pacing/cost/terminal-exclusion (real live bug, currently mis-surfacing `cc.deepthink` as an automatic failover target).
- Track3#1: scope `SESSION_CONTEXT_OVER_CAPACITY` to the active/most-recent session only, and re-derive `utilization_pct` from current `model-registry.json` at render time instead of a value baked in at write time.
- Track2-ag: recalibrate `STALE_THRESHOLD_SEC` (300 → align with actual observed effort/deepthink turn times, e.g. 600s) or link it to the per-profile timeout config instead of a hardcoded constant.

**P1 — design-approved, ready to implement (Track 4/5's converged output):** the quota-dependency display grouping and the pacing≤1.0 hard-admission-gate, exactly as specified above. This is the largest single piece of new work and touches routing-critical code (`hub.py`'s ask dispatch path) — recommend TDD, same as prior `T4x`/`T5x` batches this session.

**P2 — hygiene, low urgency:** backlog `next_action` text scrub (T44/T47 pattern), `check_docs_mece.py` root-file blindspot, the two-CLAUDE.md consolidation, `gc` removal from the global peer list, `schemas.md`/`manual.md` refresh, orphaned `.ai/sessions/` directory cleanup, `protocol.json` dead-declaration pruning (Track2-cx#7 — large surface, needs its own scoping pass before touching).

**P3 — needs a design decision before any code change:** `failure_promotion` (Track2-cx#2) and the effort-threshold fallthrough (Track2-cx#3) are both "config describes an intended behavior that was apparently abandoned mid-build" — worth a deliberate call on whether to finish wiring them or formally deprecate the knobs, rather than a mechanical fix.

---

## Implementation addendum (same night, after this doc's action plan was written)

P0 and P1 (both halves of Track4/5's converged design) were implemented and verified same-session. **P1a's actual rendering wire-up was deliberately deferred** (see below); everything else is live. Unit suite: 1143 passed, 1 xfailed (the deferred P1a wiring, documented in-line) — `_sys/tests/unit/test_at1_transaction.py::test_at1_lease_closed_on_failure` is excluded from that count, see the new finding below.

**P0 shipped** (`_sys/core/hub.py`, `_sys/cli/diag.py`, `_sys/core/snapshot.py`):
- Fixed the live failover bug (Track2-cx #1): `_snapshot_failover_choice()` now excludes `arbiter_models`/`bulk_exclude_profiles`/the terminal peer, via `_load_balancer_config()` (the correctly-unwrapped `token_load_balancing` reader) — the first delegated attempt used `_load_routing_config()` (the raw, un-unwrapped file) and silently never excluded anything; caught by re-testing against live data, not by the delegated peer's own unit tests, which mocked the wrong config shape.
- Fixed the diag.py "NEXT FAILOVER TARGET" display, which turned out to be a SEPARATE, second computation (`_next_target_line`/`render_headroom` → `_next_headroom_target`) that didn't share the hub.py fix at all — same underlying bug, two independent code paths. Both now filter through a shared `_failover_excluded_profile_ids()`.
- Fixed the `SESSION_CONTEXT_OVER_CAPACITY` false positive (Track3 #1): re-derives against current `model-registry.json` and dedupes to one alert per profile. First delegated attempt assumed `model-registry.json`'s `"models"` field is a list of `{"id":...}` objects; it's actually a dict keyed by model id — silently produced an always-empty lookup, so the "fix" didn't fix anything until caught by testing against the real file.
- Fixed `STALE_THRESHOLD_SEC` (Track2-ag): now derived from `protocol.json`'s `communication_policy.zombie_profile_map` (900s for deepthink) instead of a hardcoded 300s.

**P1a (display) — foundation shipped, wiring deferred**: `time_to_exhaustion()` (`_sys/core/quota.py`) and `_quota_dependency_groups()`/`_quota_dependency_group_text()` (`_sys/cli/diag.py`) are built and unit-tested against the exact converged-design examples. Wiring these into `render_summary()`/`render_live_quota_pools()` was deliberately NOT done same-night: it would rewrite the visible format of ~10 existing, passing tests that encode the OLD flat per-bucket assumptions (exact label text, sort order, line-budget/hidden-count arithmetic) on the actual daily-driver operator dashboard. That's a real UX change the operator should see before it ships, not a judgment call to make solo at 3am. `test_summary_and_live_share_one_dependency_group_payload` is marked `xfail(strict=True)` with this reasoning inline as the tracking marker.

**P1b (pacing gate) shipped** (`_sys/core/snapshot.py`, `_sys/core/hub.py`, `_sys/ai/routing-config.json`): `pacing_hard_gate` (enabled, max_ratio=1.0, unknown_policy=deny) added to `routing-config.json`; `pacing_admission_for_profile()` added to `snapshot.py`; wired into `select_load_balanced_peer()` (AUTO), `select_arbiter()` (with the converged DIR-005 last-resort cascade-then-carve-out for genuine dissent/high_risk triggers), and `hub.py::_action_ask_inner()` (explicit `--to`, closing the loophole the 2026-07-15 incident exposed). **Two more instances of the same "row vs raw profile" shape bug were caught and fixed during verification** (not by the delegated peer's own tests): `pacing_admission_for_profile()` needs a raw `snapshot["profiles"][i]`-shaped dict (with `quota.buckets`), matching the pre-existing `_profile_pacing_max()`'s calling convention — but both `select_load_balanced_peer()` and `select_arbiter()` were calling it with a `_derive_headroom_rows()` output row instead, which never carries `quota.buckets`. With `unknown_policy: deny` as the converged default, this meant *every* candidate read as "unknown" and got excluded — confirmed empirically: `select_load_balanced_peer()` returned `no_eligible_candidate` for every call, i.e. **the gate as first delegated would have silently disabled all AUTO routing the moment it was enabled.** Fixed by looking up the raw profile by id at both call sites (and a third instance in `hub.py`'s explicit-ask check) before calling the admission function. Re-verified against live data afterward: AUTO correctly selects `ag` (currently the only peer under 1.0x pacing); `select_arbiter` correctly returns `None` for routine work (both `cc.fable`/`cc.deepthink` are over-cap tonight) and correctly falls through to the carve-out (`cc.deepthink`) when given a `dissent` context.

**Two new findings from verification, not in the original 5-track audit:**
- **Fixed**: `_sweep_stale_ask_temp_dirs()` (`hub.py`, runs on every `action_ask`) called `entry.is_dir()` on every entry in `_sys/data/temp` before checking whether the name even matched its own `"ask_"` filter prefix — with ~5,700+ accumulated entries (mostly stray `pytest` tmp dirs and, until cleaned tonight, over 12,000 auto-generated `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*.ps1` PowerShell policy-check files), each a separate stat() syscall on this portable/cloud-synced drive, this made a routine sweep exceed pytest's 60s timeout. Fixed by reordering the check (cheap name-prefix filter before the expensive stat call) — reduces the real stat-call count from ~5,700 to the handful that actually match `"ask_*"`. The 12,000+ `__PSScriptPolicyTest_*` files were deleted (safe, auto-regenerated PowerShell artifacts).
- **NOT fixed, flagged for priority follow-up**: `_governed_files()` (`hub.py`, the LL-20260703-005 governed-mutation-guard's file-hashing walk, also runs on every `action_ask`) calls `.resolve()` on every file under `_sys/core`/`_sys/checks`/`_sys/ai` — same class of problem (per-file syscall × directory bloat × slow portable filesystem), but this is core safety-guard code (protects against out-of-band peer writes) and deserves a reviewed fix, not a rushed one. Currently causes `test_at1_transaction.py::test_at1_lease_closed_on_failure` to hang past the 60s test timeout; real-world impact on actual `hub.py ask` latency (not just tests) is plausible and worth measuring first.

**Design decisions made under time pressure, worth a second look:** `unknown_policy: deny` (the converged design's own default) is strict — any profile without fresh, correctly-shaped pacing data is refused, not just deprioritized. This surfaced 5 additional pre-existing unit tests (`test_t3_oversized_ask_guard.py`) that didn't account for the new gate at all; fixed by having that test file's shared scaffolding stub out the pacing check (an "unrelated subsystem" for what those tests actually verify, same treatment as the other stubs already there) rather than relaxing the gate's default. Worth confirming this default doesn't cause real friction once live (e.g. a profile that's simply never been measured yet, not over-cap, still reads as "unknown" -> denied under this policy).

## Terminal-quota-exhaustion resilience (new topic, raised after P0/P1b shipped, 5-way debate, FULLY UNANIMOUS after 4 rounds)

Problem: if the peer currently serving as the human-interface/terminal role runs low on/out of quota, the whole system halts (nothing can be dispatched). Live example from tonight: CC's own C-7D bucket hit 2.25x pacing while CC was actively serving as terminal. `_human_interface_peer_eligibility()` (hub.py:2538) has zero quota/pacing awareness today.

**Converged design (5/5 unanimous, cx.effort/deepthink + ag.effort/deepthink + cc.fable, 4 rounds):**

1. **Eligibility**: reuse `pacing_admission_for_profile()` (shipped tonight, snapshot.py:1280) as the sole quota signal for the terminal role too. `0.8` = advisory warning. `over_cap` (>1.0) = hard exclusion, but **only for peers trying to CLAIM/become terminal** -- never for evicting a sitting one. No premium/arbiter exemption here either.
2. **Trigger, resolving the chicken-and-egg problem**: the key insight (cc.fable, unrebutted all rounds) is that quota exhaustion only starves *model turns* -- local hub CLI commands cost zero LLM quota, so the terminal can always self-execute a handoff even at 0 quota.
   - **Primary**: dispatch-piggybacked self-check inside `_action_ask_inner()` (same region as tonight's target-gate check) -- at `0.8` show a yield-recommended banner on every outbound delegated ask; at `over_cap` **refuse further delegated asks until a handoff completes**, forcing the yield using turns that are already happening. No new polling loop.
   - **Secondary, narrow fallback only**: a host-side `terminal-duty-sweep` CLI command (schedulable via Windows Task Scheduler and/or run at hub invocation boundaries) fires **only on freshness-lapse/silence** (the terminal has gone fully unresponsive/crashed) -- never on routine pacing. Different failure mode, different mechanism; don't conflate them.
3. **Correctness prerequisite (verified against code by both cx.deepthink and cc.fable independently, must ship together with the above, not after)**:
   - New atomic `terminal-handoff` action (one state-lock transaction) that actually updates `human_interface_peer` + `active_console_peer` + leadership + a handoff record together. Today's `leader-yield`+`leader-claim` only move leadership to VACANT and back (hub.py:6648-6677) and never touch terminal identity -- a real vacancy/challenge gap, not a working handoff.
   - Fix `_select_human_interface_peer()` (hub.py:2633-2645): it currently tries the configured default (`cc`) FIRST unconditionally (`reason: "configured_default"`) before evaluating anything else -- a recorded handoff away from cc would silently snap back the instant cc's own eligibility returns. A fresh recorded handoff must outrank the configured default; default becomes the tie-break, not the trump card.
4. **Reserve floor: `5%`, explicitly config-tagged `declared_unverified`** (same shape/precedent as the existing `shared_quota_reserve` block) -- blocks new delegated dispatch once the serving family's remaining headroom crosses the floor, but always permits the handoff/control-plane actions themselves. To be replaced by a measured p95-based value once real handoff-cost telemetry exists; the design must state plainly that 5% is a policy safety rail, not evidence of measured sufficiency (this is what resolved the one real disagreement in the debate -- three peers initially held "0%, DIR-004 forbids any unmeasured number," and were persuaded only once the honesty tag was made explicit, plus an unrebutted "0% risks thrashing right at the 0.8 trigger line" argument).
5. **No forced mid-session eviction.** A sitting terminal crossing the cap becomes `handoff_required`: loses the ability to issue NEW delegated dispatches, but keeps full control-plane/local-command capability to complete its own handoff cleanly -- consistent with tonight's own observed reality (CC kept functioning fine at 2.25x). Fail-open exception: if literally every eligible peer is over-cap simultaneously, the sitting terminal remains as least-bad (logged), rather than creating a total vacancy with nobody in control.

## Quota display v2 (post-ship refinement, 5-way debate, 3 rounds to unanimous)

After Track4/5 Q1 shipped (dynamic binding-first reordering), the user reviewed live output and pushed back: swapping which window (5H/7D) appears first per row breaks scannability. Requested fixed positions plus a single composite urgency index. New 5-way debate, same panel.

**Converged design (5/5 unanimous):**
1. **Fixed order**: always render `5H` then `7D` in the same position -- never reordered by which one binds. Binding information moves to a marker (`▸`) on the binding bucket in its fixed slot, not by repositioning.
2. **Composite index "URG"**: `URG = max_i(reset_hours_i / eta_full_i)` over a pool's buckets (`eta_full` = `time_to_exhaustion()`, already shipped). This is the continuous form of the existing binary binding test (`eta < reset_hours`) -- `URG >= 1.00` means the pool projects to exhaust before its own reset. Two independent peers (ag.effort, cc.fable) derived this identical ratio unprompted in Round A; by Round B all 5 converged on it, rejecting both a raw max-pacing-ratio composite (loses reset-timing context) and a categorical-only label (loses triage gradation between e.g. binding-at-1.06x vs binding-at-5.0x).
3. **Format**: 2-decimal float + "x" suffix (e.g. "2.21x", "0.16x") -- matches the format already used for pacing ratios elsewhere in the same row, avoiding an integer that could misread as a percentage. Zero burn -> "0.00x". Some buckets absent -> "≥" lower-bound prefix (never guessed higher). All buckets absent -> "absent".
4. **Thresholds**: 🔴 URG >= 1.00x, 🟡 URG >= 0.80x, 🟢 else -- mirrors the existing pacing-ratio glyph convention.

**Example render** (live numbers from the debate):
```
POOL         URG          5H              7D
AG  3P-pool  🔴 2.21x     0%  0.00x   |▸ 67% 1.02x
CC  C-pool   🟢 0.16x    ▸18% 0.22x   |   2% 0.08x
CX  X-pool   🟢 ≥0.00x   absent       |▸  0% 0.00x
```

**Implementation pointers**: add pure `quota_urgency()`/`URG` computation beside `time_to_exhaustion()` in `_sys/core/quota.py` (or compute inline in the grouping function, reusing `time_to_exhaustion()` and each bucket's `reset_hours` -- both already available inside `_quota_dependency_groups()`). Rewrite `_quota_dependency_group_text()` in `_sys/cli/diag.py` to the fixed-column render above; `_quota_dependency_groups()`'s classification (`binding`/`safe`/`absent` state, `primary`/`secondary` buckets) stays the SSOT, URG is a display-layer computation on top of it. `render_summary()` and `render_live_quota_pools()` continue sharing the same text function (no-drift property preserved).

## Narrow-terminal degradation for quota pool lines (5-way debate, 3 rounds to unanimous)

User asked whether `diag` handles narrow terminal widths. Found: `render_live_quota_pools()` only had naive tail-truncation (`_elide_display()`, drops whatever's at the end regardless of importance); `render_summary()` had zero width handling at all.

**Converged design (5/5 unanimous):**
1. **Field-aware candidate generation, not tail-truncation.** Generate tier candidates in priority order, pick the richest whose `_dw()` fits the budget (robust to variable pool-name/reset-text length -- a fixed column-count breakpoint table would be fragile). `_elide_display()` survives only as the absolute last-resort safety net below the narrowest semantic tier.
2. **Priority ladder** (drop order as width shrinks): reset-time suffix first -> pace ratios inside window slots (keep used%, keep `▸`/`~` markers) -> the numeric URG index and the non-binding window drop TOGETHER, leaving `OWNER POOL <glyph> ▸<window-label> <pct>` (e.g. `AG 3P 🔴 ▸7D 67%`) as the narrowest semantic floor. Nominal widths (fit-based selection is authoritative, these are for tests/docs): T0≈76 full+reset, T1≈62 drop reset, T2≈46 drop pace ratios, T3≈32 glyph+labeled-binding-window only.
   - Resolution history: Round A split 3 ways (drop-windows-keep-URG / drop-URG-keep-windows / keep-everything-compress). Round B converged 3-2 toward drop-URG-keep-binding-window, with cc.fable switching camps citing DIR-004: "URG is *derived*; used% is *measured* -- when width forces a choice, the raw fact outlives the synthesis." A final round resolved the last 2 holdouts (cx.effort, cx.deepthink), who conceded that the non-binding window's value "does not change the immediate operator action" once a different bucket has already proven to bind, and that explicit window labeling is required regardless once two-slot geometry can't fit (position stops encoding which window it is).
3. **TTY detection**: `columns = shutil.get_terminal_size().columns if sys.stdout.isatty() else None` for `render_summary()` (piped/redirected/logged output gets full, unlimited data -- logs want completeness, not narrowing). `render_live_quota_pools()` keeps its existing caller-supplied `columns` unchanged (already inherently an interactive-TTY context).
4. **Header-tier sync**: column headers must track the same tier as the rows (a header advertising "5H 7D" over rows that dropped those slots is a rendering bug). One shared `_quota_columns_for_tier(tier)` feeds both header and row construction in both render paths. **Tier is selected ONCE per section** (the tightest tier any row in that section needs), not per-row, so columns stay aligned across rows.

**Implementation pointers**: one shared candidate-generating formatter (extends `_quota_dependency_group_text()`) used by both `render_summary()` and `_live_quota_pool_line()`/`render_live_quota_pools()` -- same no-drift principle as the rest of tonight's quota work.

## Backlog resolution directions (5-way debate, 2 rounds to unanimous)

Five "declared but unenforced" items from Track2-cx needed a direction call: finish wiring vs deprecate. Full unanimous convergence reached, with real position changes (not just majority pressure) -- notably cc.fable's Round A dissents on C/D/E turned out to persuade all 4 others in Round B, and ag.deepthink's lone Round A "wire" vote on A conceded in Round B.

**Converged directions (5/5 unanimous):**
- **A. `protocol.json`'s `workload.routing_rules` + most of `collab_rate`** -- **DEPRECATE.** Prune the 7 dead routing-rule entries and unconsumed policy fields (`risk_table`, `r10_semantics`, `zero_token_allowlist`, `operation_classes`, `action_policy`, the duplicate `requires_unanimous`). Keep only fields with real consumers (`current`, review-interval fields). Document R:10 unanimity as the hardcoded (`hub.py:6024-6034`) reality, not a second decorative declaration. Reason: wiring these for real would mean building a governance rules-engine to justify decoration -- disproportionate cost for zero current value.
- **B. `failure_promotion`** -- **DEPRECATE** (unanimous from Round A, no dissent at any point). Remove the block (`routing-config.json:75-90`) entirely. Finishing it requires a semantic quality/test/reasoning failure classifier that doesn't exist -- a genuinely new subsystem, not a small fix. Re-propose as a designed feature if ever actually wanted.
- **C. `effort_score` medium-band fallthrough** -- **NOT a defect; document as intentional.** cc.fable's reframe (unanimously accepted by Round B): high->deepthink, low->effort, ambiguous->configured-default is a coherent three-way design, not broken threshold math. The actual defect was that config/docs implied the score decides everything when it only decides the extremes. Fix: keep the code exactly as-is, explicitly declare/document the trichotomy, add boundary tests proving the fallthrough is intentional (not an accidental gap).
- **D. Arbiter triggers (`dissent`/`high_risk`/`r10_final`)** -- **SPLIT.** Wire `r10_final`: its enforcement already exists hardcoded at `hub.py:6024-6034`; emitting the trigger from that existing path is a small, closed truthfulness fix, not a new classifier. Deprecate `high_risk` (needs a risk classifier that doesn't exist -- same problem class as item B) and deprecate the orphaned `authority` config key (duplicates an already-hardcoded authority path -- two sources of truth for one fact).
- **E. Session-policy modes (`auto`/`reuse`/`fresh`/`none`)** -- **NOT a defect; keep all four, fix documentation only.** The sharpest reversal of the night: cc.fable's Round A dissent ("unexercised != unenforced -- all four modes are wired and enforced; they merely collapse to two observed behaviors because every current peer happens to declare `reuse`. Deleting `auto`/`fresh` would remove working capability a future peer config could legitimately use tomorrow") persuaded all four other peers, who had originally voted unanimously to deprecate. Verify all 4 branches are genuinely reachable/correct with synthetic parameterized tests (not just the 2 the current fleet exercises), update docs to state today's fleet only exercises the `reuse` pairing, optionally add a config-lint fleet-coverage note. Do not remove any code.

**Meta-lesson**: two of five items (C, E) that were originally FRAMED as "declared but unenforced drift" (this session's dominant defect pattern) turned out, on closer unanimous scrutiny, to NOT actually be that defect at all -- C is intentional fallthrough design under-documented, E is correctly-implemented capability that's simply unexercised by the current fleet. Worth remembering going forward: not every "config says X, but only Y is observed" finding is drift -- check whether the code path for X actually exists and works before concluding it's dead.
