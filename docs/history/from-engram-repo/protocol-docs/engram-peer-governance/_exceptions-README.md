# _exceptions — Non-MECE Items, Edge Cases & Noise

This folder holds items that don't cleanly fit the General/Specific/Ops/User taxonomy, or represent extreme edge cases and known noise. Review periodically and reclassify when scope becomes clear.

## Classification Guide

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Doc spans multiple categories | Place canonical content in PRIMARY category; cross-ref note in secondary. No duplication. |
| Workspace state (not rule/spec) | Belongs in `_archive/` or `_sys/docs/history/`, not here. |
| Genuine ambiguity | Place here with a classification note below. |
| Noise / low-signal | Place here with a note; candidate for deletion at next audit. |

## Open Edge Cases

### EDGE-01: ~~model-registry.json and routing-config.json not yet created~~ (RESOLVED 2026-06-18)

Both files created (both later removed in the Engram/peerhub separation):
- `model-registry.json` v1.0 (10 models: cc/gc/cx) — validated_at "2026-06-18", confidence levels set
- `routing-config.json` v1.0 (R01-R12 role taxonomy routing weights)
- Additional new files: `error-taxonomy.json`, `logging-config.json`
- Schemas documented in `ops/schemas.md`; architecture decisions in
  `_sys/docs/history/ops/peer-debate-2026-06-19.md` (archived).

### EDGE-02: ~~`.ai/` vs `_sys/ai/` path inconsistency~~ (RESOLVED 2026-06-18)

Verified: `.ai/sessions/` exists at root (`P:\.ai\sessions\room-*`). Path in session.md is correct.
`_sys/ai/` holds config/state files (protocol.json, peers.json, etc.); `.ai/` holds runtime IPC (sessions, mailbox).
**Resolution:** Closed — no fix needed. Paths serve different purposes and are both correct.

### EDGE-03: ~~master-plan.md implementation status unknown~~ (RESOLVED — archived)

`general/master-plan.md` moved to `_sys/docs/history/general/master-plan.md` (dropped via 5-Whys, per docs-v2/00-MANIFEST.md's Archived section). Provenance-only; not a live unresolved edge.

### EDGE-04: ~~check_docs_mece.py not yet implemented~~ (RESOLVED)

Implemented at `_sys/checks/check_docs_mece.py` and wired into `self_care.py` (invoked there directly). INV-19 and the coverage map are now mechanically enforced, not peer-discipline-only.

### EDGE-05: No automated path from active-lessons.jsonl → docs-v2 (feedback loop open)

**Root cause (gc exhaustive audit, 2026-06-18):** The feedback loop has an open gap at the Directive-to-Normative Graduation step.
- `runtime-directives.jsonl` corrects behavior with TTL. `active-lessons.jsonl` accumulates lessons.
- **Missing:** No automated trigger promotes a high-frequency lesson from `active-lessons.jsonl` into a permanent `docs-v2` rule or `10-invariants.md` entry.
- **Risk:** Directives expire → lessons bloat context without being synthesized into SSOT architecture. Root fixes remain implicit, not structural.
**Current state:** DocsSyncer (learning.md §4) handles `consensus_finalize` → docs-v2 sync. But there is no lesson-frequency threshold check that triggers a promotion proposal.
**Resolution:** Implement **Semantic Vector Triage & Automated Doc-as-Code Graduation** in the Ask Transaction roadmap (learning.md §5).
1. **Semantic Clustering**: `self_care.py` calculates embeddings for each new lesson and clusters them by semantic similarity, rather than naive frequency counting.
2. **Density Threshold**: When a semantic cluster reaches a density threshold (e.g., ≥3 related lessons in 7 days), the system identifies the most relevant `docs-v2` file via cosine similarity.
3. **Automated Patch Generation**: `self_care.py` automatically spawns an agent to generate a `[PROPOSAL]` diff that refactors the target document to structurally address the root cause (5-Whys application).
4. **Quorum Vote**: Automatically invoke `hub.py proposal-add` to trigger an R:10 consensus vote. Upon ACK, the diff is applied and the cluster is marked graduated.
