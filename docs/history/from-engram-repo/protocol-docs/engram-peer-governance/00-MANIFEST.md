# docs-v2 MANIFEST
> Version: 2.0 | Date: 2026-06-26 | Purpose: Workspace SSOT (Active) — sole exhaustive index
> Language: All docs in English (INV-19). Console output to user: Korean only.
> Principles: MECE · General-Specific · Lazy-load (token-efficient) · Doc-as-Code (ops/governance.md §6)
> Status: **ACTIVE SSOT** — superseded/dated docs archived to `_sys/docs/history/` (reference only).

> ⚠️ **Pre-separation notice (2026-09-03):** see `MOC.md`'s matching notice — this whole
> index (and everything it indexes) predates the Engram/peerhub separation and describes
> the old hub.py-integrated architecture. Its own disposition is a real, tracked,
> deliberately-unresolved open question, not silently dropped.

## Doc-status taxonomy (GAP-3)
Every doc carries one status. The MANIFEST is the single exhaustive index; `MOC.md` is a short keyword load-map only.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **living** | Active contract — the current rule of record. |
| **design** | Signed consensus/design spec for an unstarted/in-progress Ask-Transaction slice; migrates into a living pillar + archives once its slice lands (per `ops/backlog-5whys-consensus-2026-06-26.md` R1). |
| **historical** | Point-in-time record (dated debate/benchmark/audit) in `_sys/docs/history/`; provenance only. |
| **superseded-by** | Replaced; pointer to the doc that absorbed it. |

---

## Load Order (peer startup)

```
EAGER (always):
  10-invariants.md      ← FIRST: hard rules (INV-01~31, PRO-01~19, +GAP-1 clause)
  20-architecture.md    ← directory layout, PathMap, brain layers, connectivity map

LAZY (load when domain needed — see MOC.md for keyword index):
  general/protocol.md   ← governance/roles (GAP-1), COLLAB_RATE, consensus, communication/IPC, command contract (GAP-3)
  general/routing.md    ← peer/model routing, leader election, failover, resource governance
  general/lifecycle.md  ← session resume/handoff, health states, ContextGate policy
  general/learning.md   ← 5-Whys loop, directives, knowledge propagation, self-care bounds
  general/permissions.md← minimum permission model, DIR-002
  specific/{peer_id}.md ← delta only (load AFTER general/)
```

For navigation by domain: `MOC.md`. For human onboarding: `user/manual.md`.

| `ops/endgame-general-specific-plan-2026-06-28.md` | superseded-by → `ops/phase2-arch-general-specific-2026-07-22.md` | Implementation-ready no-code/composable General-Specific endgame plan; sat unimplemented for ~4 weeks, found duplicating a fresh 5-round debate on 2026-07-22 (same core problem re-litigated without awareness of this doc); its still-valuable structural pieces (cleanup policy, traceability ledger, completion loop, adapter field taxonomy) were absorbed into the superseding doc rather than lost | 2026-06-28 |
| `ops/hub-mutation-broker.md` | design | Host-side broker/queue authority boundary for `.ai` mutations under managed sandboxes | 2026-06-29 |
| `ops/peer-cli-reference.md` | living | Execution-verified feature reference for claude.cmd/codex.cmd/agy.exe: modes, session/resume, models, sandbox, quirks | 2026-07-02 |
| `ops/status-consolidation-2026-07-08.md` | living | Reconciliation point for the 2026-07-07/08 work stream: shipped commits, pending/backlog, MECE, freshness | 2026-07-08 |
| `ops/intelligence-scores.md` | living | Composite model intelligence scores (declared, unverified) + profile/arbiter policy recommendations; documented-only pending R:10 | 2026-07-13 |
| `ops/profile-policy.md` | living | MECE profile framework: taxonomy (tier/specialty) · capability · quota-family economics (C/F/G/3P/X) · load-balancing gates · terminal token minimization; config changes deferred to R:10 | 2026-07-13 |
| `ops/profile-policy-decisions.md` | living | Ratified R:10 decisions + TDD-ready specs for the deferred profile/LB items (D1-D9); 2 verified P0 enforcement defects (bulk-exclude bypass, terminal-identity mismatch) | 2026-07-13 |
| `ops/capability-leveling.md` | living | Capability-leveling framework: per-axis evidence-qualified vector (perf/context/resource) · measured>operational>declared>absent · purpose fitness (bulk/arbiter/complexity) · Phase 0 docs-only, unblocks D1/D5; supersedes-in-spirit the composite scalar (now the declared bootstrap layer) | 2026-07-13 |
| `ops/quota-balance-decisions.md` | living | Quota balance + statusline display decisions (cx+ag+cc.fable): the session imbalance was behavioral (0 load_balance_route / 69 direct_ask — LB never called), pacing already default-ON, ag.opus 429 = provider Opus overload not idle quota (stays manual; 3P used via ag.gptoss). Plan: all-buckets statusline + explicit pacing flag + fungible-bulk→--to auto + telemetry, then observe. Spawns T55-T57 | 2026-07-15 |
| `ops/statusline-quota-display-handoff-2026-07-15.md` | living | Statusline all-buckets shape-driven formatter design handoff (presentation-only, %-only, never fabricate F-7D; ag.effort approved, ag.opus review died on provider 429); unapplied → T55 | 2026-07-15 |
| `ops/hard-benchmark-decisions.md` | living | T48: hard-benchmark design (parametric generators, discrimination contract, calibration≠certification) + two ratifiable calls — DECOUPLE D1 from a measured reasoning edge (frontier peers tie at ceiling), code-exec has no admin-free jail (restricted-DSL/absent), agentic 80↔100 is a PTY line-ending artifact (prompt-via-file fix). cx+ag+cc.fable | 2026-07-14 |
| `ops/closure-review-2026-07-17.md` | living | Purpose-centered final closure review (8-lens, 5-way debate): confirmed INV-03 voter-filtering violation (fixed), ungated governed-mutation bypass (fixed), directive-add/clear misclassification (fixed), plus 4 deferred architectural items (dual consensus engines, governance_params pruning, pacing confirmation_count, session auto-scoping) | 2026-07-17 |
| `ops/closure-review-2026-07-17-round2.md` | living | Round 2 closure review: ag zombie phenomenon diagnosed+partially fixed (post-progress 300s tightening, measured; auto-retry deferred with converged design), critical 41GB orphaned node/codex process leak found+fixed (diag probe tree-kill), full error/bug log, prompt-design lesson on multi-peer dispatch scoping | 2026-07-17 |
| `ops/zombie-deep-dive-2026-07-18.md` | living | Zombie deep-dive: found+fixed a ~4-week IPC single-use regex bug (655 files, c2f88e4), found reuse-after-failure is a 20x zombie predictor (0feb3f3), CONFIRMED the 07-18 mystery dispatch origin (cx.deepthink self-orchestration, literal command logs) — causal mechanism for ag's baseline ~2.7% stall rate remains genuinely unresolved after two forensic passes | 2026-07-18 |
| `ops/external-server-ization-proposal-review-2026-07-19.md` | living | External proposal review (3-way unanimous, ag.deepthink+cx.deepthink+cc.fable): REJECT server-izing Engram into a multi-tenant backend for a third-party integration — poor generic/specific separation (violates INV-29), scope graft not a generalization (conflicts INV-17/PRO-05/PRO-13/PRO-12), document's claimed prior consensus + "existing service" claims both unverifiable/overstated (DIR-004). Counter-proposal: extract capability-leveling/resolver as a standalone library for the requesting party's own separate service. | 2026-07-19 |
| `ops/phase1-docs-audit-open-items-2026-07-22.md` | living | Phase 1 docs MECE audit close-out: 4 concrete open items (semantic-truth checking gap in check_docs_mece.py, skills/templates restructure decision, Three-Layer knowledge propagation still unbuilt beyond Layer 2, manual.md pointing at a historical design doc for a live system) + 2 MECE-excluded edge cases (duplicate-named AGY.md files, docs/history left intentionally unaudited) | 2026-07-22 |
| `ops/phase2-arch-general-specific-2026-07-22.md` | design | No-code, config-driven, General-Specific MECE architecture for multi-platform/installed-elsewhere Engram (R:10, ag.deepthink+cx.effort+cc, 5 rounds): 4 logical stores (immutable core / shared config / shared mutable data / workspace state) replacing PORTABLE_ROOT coupling; RuntimeContext with explicit CLI>bootstrap-manifest>discovery precedence; versioned+catalog-checked adapter contract (peer_instances reference a logical implementation ID only, never an importable string path) against the real PeerAdapter interface; 4 declared un-generalizable exceptions; SUBST/junction demoted to an explicitly user-confirmed Legacy Migration Backend (260-char MAX_PATH justification empirically verified: a real repo file measures 267 chars without the P:\ shortcut). Architecture only -- not yet implemented, Phase 3 is exact schema/interface detail. | 2026-07-22 |
| `ops/cli-update-checkpoints-agy.md` | living | agy CLI update checkpoints (install/version evidence) | 2026-08-19 |
| `ops/cli-update-checkpoints-cc.md` | living | claude CLI update checkpoints (install/version evidence) | 2026-08-19 |

| `ops/residual-backlog-and-packaging-precheck-2026-07-26.md` | design | Residual packaging/release precheck backlog | 2026-07-26 |
| `user/manual.md` | living | Human onboarding, daily workflow, command reference | 2026-06-26 |
| `user/requirements.md` | living | Root requirement contract (A1-A5...) — source of intent | 2026-06-26 |
| `_exceptions/README.md` | living | Active ambiguity register (small; not a backlog) | 2026-06-26 |

### Archived (`_sys/docs/history/`) — superseded/historical, not loaded
general (merged into pillars): `consensus`,`communication`,`tradeoffs` → protocol.md; `resource-governance` → routing.md; `session`,`health`,`token-management` → lifecycle.md; `self-evolution`,`feedback-loop`,`directives`,`knowledge` → learning.md; `master-plan`,`master-refactor-v5` → dropped (5-Whys).
specific: `statusline_diag_update` → merged into ops/logging.md §12 + user/manual.md.
ops (dated/superseded): `peer-debate-2026-06-19`,`automatic-profile-routing-2026-06-20`,`perf-benchmark-2026-06-19(+full)`,`consistency-audit-2026-06-24`,`TDD_PLAN_HUB_V42`,`REMAINING_ACTIONS`,`remaining-items`.
ops (AT-implemented specs, archived under AT-6): `docs-restructure-blueprint-2026-06-26`,`per-profile-health-b1-design`(→AT-3),`standard-capability-consensus-2026-06-25`(→AT-4/AT-5),`terminal-health-misread-consensus-2026-06-25`(→AT-2/AT-6),`full-audit-2026-06-26`(→AT-0/AT-2/AT-6).
common: `peer-rules` (2026-07-22): remaining un-migrated content (IPC single-use naming clarification, Hub Ask Timeout guidance) merged into protocol.md §7.1; the rest was already covered by protocol.md/lifecycle.md. CLAUDE.md/CODEX.md/AGY.md's "Shared rules" pointers updated accordingly.

## General-Specific Inheritance

```
10-invariants.md  (absolute — no override)
       ↓
general/*.md      (5 MECE pillars — ALL peers inherit)
       ↓
specific/{id}.md  (delta only — lists ONLY what differs from general)
```
