# Specific — cc (Claude Code)
> Delta-only from general/*. Status: ACTIVE.

> **Ported from Engram 2026-09-03** (was `_sys/docs-v2/...`; see Engram's `_sys/data/sessions/2026-09-03_docsv2-disposition-proposal.md` for the full disposition). Content is otherwise verbatim from the original -- some internal path references (e.g. `_sys/ai/orchestration.json`, `_sys/ai/model-registry.json`, `P:\`) point at Engram's now-deleted `_sys/ai/` tree or the frozen `P:\` checkout and describe the OLD pre-separation update-checkpoint workflow; they have not been individually rewritten for peerhub's own conventions yet -- treat any such reference as historical context, not a current instruction, until this doc gets a real pass.

- **Project Config:** `P:\CLAUDE.md` (consumed by Claude Code CLI at startup).

## Permission Flags
```
claude -p {query} --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

## Runtime Profiles
| Profile | Model | Effort | CLI context observed |
|---|---|---|---:|
| `cc.standard` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | low | 200k |
| `cc.effort` | `claude-sonnet-5` | high | 1M |
| `cc.deepthink` | `claude-opus-5` | high | 1M |
| `cc.fable` | `claude-fable-5` | high | 1M |

All four profiles were live-validated with their declared `--model` and `--effort` on 2026-07-27. Claude Code lacks a zero-token catalog command, so direct minimal invocations are the availability check.

## Session & State
- **Session reuse:** hub IPC asks reuse per `session_mode: reuse` (orchestration.json), scoped by `room_id`. The interactive human-facing cc terminal is a separate fresh session per launch.
- **Local Memory:** Claude-local memory is not automatically shared with other peers.

## Gate & Entry
- **Gate script:** `claude-gate.bat` (removed in Engram/peerhub separation)
- **Status check:** `claude-status.bat`

## Update Protocol & Health
- `config/CLAUDE.md` — update via `ctx-end --global` or manual edit.
- `config/projects/*/memory/` — auto-managed by cc memory system.
- `health.json` — ONLY via `hub.py health-update --peer cc`.
- **Auto-Remediation (INV-15/16):** cc cannot be auto-restarted silently by SelfHealer Tier-0/1. On RED state: SelfHealer logs the event and escalates to Human Gate.

## Context and Collaboration
*(Delta from general/protocol.md + general/learning.md.)*
- **Primary human-interface terminal:** cc most often holds the thin-terminal role (GAP-1/PRO-19) — routes/relays, does not self-analyze once a worker is selected.
- **Local memory is private:** cc's `projects/*/memory/` is NOT auto-propagated to peers; durable cross-peer knowledge must go through the lesson/directive loop (general/learning.md), not cc-local memory.
